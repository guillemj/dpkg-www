.SH NAME
dpkg-www \- program to remotely open a WWW Debian package browser

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg-www
.I [-s|--stdout] [-h|--host host] [query]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpkg-www
is used to remotely control a web browser and open a dpkg
URL on the local host from an interactive shell or script.

If the command is invoked while running under X-window the script
will try to find an installed X browser to open the specified URL.
If not running under X it will try to use a text browser instead.

If one of the known browsers is found and there is an instance already
running it will be asked to open the dpkg URL on localhost with the optional
.I query
supplied on the command line.
If there is no browser running, it will start automatically a new one.

The functionality provided by this program is identical to running
a web browser with the
.B \-remote openURL(http://localhost/cgi-bin/dpkg)
argument or opening the same URL from within the browser.

.B dpkg-www-installer
is an helper application which can configured in the WWW browser for web
installation. It should never be invoked directly by the user.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stdout\fR
Redirect output to stdout. Requires one of the text browsers (elinks,
links2, links or w3m) installed.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-host\fR \fBhost\fR
Send the query to a remote host, where dpkg-www must be installed.
.TP
.BI query
Specifies an optional package name, an absolute pathname or a query
argument which is passed to the dpkg cgi-bin. See
.BR dpkg-www(8)
for more information about the use of the CGI.

.SH FILES
.IP /etc/dpkg-www.conf
.IP ~/.dpkg-www
Configuration files for dpkg-www. It is not necessary for these files to exist,
there are sensible defaults for everything, but you can specify your preferred
www browser with the DPKG_WWW_BROWSER variable, for example:
.B DPKG_WWW_BROWSER=firefox
