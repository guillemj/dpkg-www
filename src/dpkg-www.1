.SH NAME
dpkg\-www \- program to remotely open a WWW Debian package browser

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg-www
.RB [ \-s | \-\-stdout ]
.RB [ \-h | "\-\-host \fIhost\fP" ]
.RI [ query ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpkg\-www
is used to remotely control a web browser and open a dpkg
URL on the local host from an interactive shell or script.

If the command is invoked while running under the X Window System the
script will try to find an installed X browser to open the specified URL.
If not running under X, it will try to use a text browser instead.

If one of the known browsers is found and there is an instance already
running it will be asked to open the dpkg URL on localhost with the optional
.I query
supplied on the command line.
If there is no browser running, it will start automatically a new one.

The functionality provided by this program is identical to running
a web browser with the
.B \-remote openURL(http://localhost/cgi\-bin/dpkg)
argument or opening the same URL from within the browser.

.BR dpkg\-www\-installer (8)
is an helper application which can configured in the WWW browser for web
installation. It should never be invoked directly by the user.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-stdout
Redirect output to stdout. Requires one of the text browsers (elinks,
links2, links or w3m) installed.

Send the query to a remote host, where \fBdpkg\-www\fP must be installed.
.TP
.I query
Specifies an optional package name, an absolute pathname or a query
argument which is passed to the dpkg cgi\-bin. See

for more information about the use of the CGI.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/dpkg\-www.conf
.TQ
.I ~/.dpkg\-www
Configuration files for \fBdpkg\-www\fP.
It is not necessary for these files to exist, there are sensible defaults

variable, for example
.BR DPKG_WWW_BROWSER=firefox .
