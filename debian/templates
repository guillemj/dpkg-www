Template: dpkg-www/update-apache-config
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want to change the apache(-ssl) configuration?
 Allowing access to /cgi-bin/dpkg from any foreign host could allow
 a malicious external user to know your installed packages and try
 possible security exploits. You should therefore disable access
 to dpkg-www from foreign hosts. With apache(-ssl) you should add
 the following lines to /etc/apache(-ssl)/access.conf:
 .
    # Disable execution of dpkg from remote hosts
    <Location /cgi-bin/dpkg>
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    allow from localhost
    allow from .your.domain
    </Location>
 .
 If you answer YES to this question and the apache configuration files
 are found the dpkg-www installation script will make these changes
 automatically for you. If apache is not installed, you are using a
 different httpd server or you answer NO to this question you should
 make the appropriate changes yourself.
