dpkg-www for Debian
-------------------

Web based Debian package browser.

With this CGI program you can browse Debian packages using a web browser.
You can easily follow package dependencies and browse package documentation
with a mouse click.

If you have properly configured the package you can also query which packages
own a non-installed file or have a certain value in a control field.

You can even install or remove packages from your browser if this feature is
enabled in the site configuration file.

WARNING!
Allowing access to /cgi-bin/dpkg from any foreign host could allow a
malicious external user to know your installed packages and try possible
security exploits. You should therefore disable access to dpkg-www from
foreign hosts. With apache you should add a file with the following
instructions into apache conf-available directory:

    # Disable execution of dpkg from remote hosts
    <Location /cgi-bin/dpkg>
        require local
        # require ip 192.168.0
    </Location>

The dpkg-www installation script will automatically install a default
configuration file in /etc/apache2/conf-available/. If you are using a
different httpd server you should make the appropriate changes in the
proper httpd config file.

Enabling the web installation feature could potentially introduce
security holes in your system and your network. Use at yout own risk!
